####  Effect Modes  ###
#######################
##
## There are 5 modes that you can choose from of effects: SELF_PERMANENT, SELF_RECURRENT, SELF_ON_HIT, TARGET_ON_HIT, BOTH_ON_HIT; not all effects works with all modes, but you'll get warned if you choose and invalid mode for that potion type, so don't you worry
##
## 1. SELF_PERMANENT will just apply the potion when the charm is equipped, and remove it and the item is removed from one of the valid slots
## 2. SELF_RECURRENT will reapply the potion after the chosen delay, and keep reapplying it until the item is removed from one of the allowed slots
## 3. SELF_ON_HIT will apply the potion to the owner of the charm, and delay represents the minimum delay between two reaplication of the effect on any given target
## 4. TARGET_ON_HIT will apply the potion to any entity damaged by the owner of the charm, and delay represents the minimum delay between two reaplication of the effect on any given target
## 5. BOTH_ON_HIT will apply the potion to both owner and any entity damaged by the owner of the charm, and delay represents the minimum delay between two reaplication of the effect on any given target
#########################
####  Particle Modes  ###
#########################
##
## There are 5 different particle modes you can choose from: NONE, SELF_ONCE, ON_SELF_WHEN_APPLIED, ON_TARGET_WHEN_APPLIED, ON_BOTH_WHEN_APPLIED; some of them only works with certain effect modes
##
## 1. NONE will disable any particle effect (if you don't specify any particle, it'll also default to "none")
## 2. SELF_ONCE will spawn particles one time, when the effect is gained, on self, can only be used with SELF_PERMANENT effect mode
## 3. SELF_WHEN_APPLIED can be used for SELF_RECURRENT, SELF_ON_HIT, TARGET_ON_HIT, and for BOTH_ON_HIT effect modes, it'll spawn particles every time the effect occurs, on self
## 4. TARGET_WHEN_APPLIED is only a valid particle mode for SELF_ON_HIT, TARGET_ON_HIT, and BOTH_ON_HIT effect modes, it'll spawn particles on the target, every time the effect occurs
## 5. BOTH_WHEN_APPLIED is also only a valid particle mode for SELF_ON_HIT, TARGET_ON_HIT, and BOTH_ON_HIT effect modes, it'll spawn particles on both self and the target, every time the effect happens
## Below you can create as many effects as you want, and link them with the items from `loot_table.yml` file
