# InfernalMobsReloaded Public Configuration
The configuration files for Easy SMP's Infernal Mobs Reloaded. Feel free to contribute!

## What is InfernalMobsReloaded?
InfernalMobReloaded was a plugin created to fix Elminator's Infernal Mobs erratic, poorly optimized, poorly formatted, and buggy behavior. When we forwarded our concerns to the author we were left without support. The community of Infernal Mobs was maintaining a plugin that shouldn't have made it past 1.16 without a proper rewrite by the author. The community helped chip in $80 for a rewrite by a proper developer that is experienced and thus InfernalMobsReloaded was born. So far, it's barely caused any issues and any issues caused by InfernalMobsReloaded have been fixed by [SecretX](https://github.com/SecretX33). Did I mention I have no record of it breaking from MC versions completely? Now, the community can contribute to our configuration so they have a really good say in how they experience Minecraft.
## Preview
You can view the final production result on our public Minecraft server `play.2v1.me`. 
If you wish to test your configuration, you may do so on our private test server. IP is `ts.2v1.me`.
It's whitelist only, so you'll need to contact an Admin+ in our Discord to get whitelisted.
